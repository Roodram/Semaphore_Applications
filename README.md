# Semaphore_Applications
Application of semaphores to implement Synchronization problems

### Custom_Semaphores
I have implemented the semaphores in a header file "semaphore2.h" and included and used the same in the corresponding .cpp files.

To run a custom_semaphores based implementation make sure that the "semaphore2.h" file is in the same folder as the .cpp file.
  
### Inbuilt Semaphores
These implementations use the inbuilt c++ library "semaphore.h" in the corresponding .cpp files.

### How to Run

To run the .cpp file, run the following commands:
1. g++ -pthread <filename>.cpp
2. ./a.out
